The dataset which is used is a retail dataset of the global superstore for 4 years. Let's delve into it using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and trends. Various charts and graphs are used to visualize the data.

Both univariate and bivariate analyses are conducted. Univariate analysis examines each variable individually, while bivariate analysis explores the relationships between two variables. This helps to understand how different factors impact store sales.

Data Statistics Performed in Univariate Analysis:

Histogram: To visualize the distribution of key numeric variables.

Sales Distribution by Category: To visualize the distribution of sales across different categories using a pie chart.

Time Series Plot: To understand the trends and patterns in sales over the 4 years.

Sales Variation over time: To observe how sales vary over different periods (months, years, quarters).

Data Statistics Performed in Bivariate Analysis:

Shipping Mode vs sales: To explore the relationship between shipping mode and sales using a pie chart.

Customer Segment Analysis: To explore sales trends for different customer segments using a bar chart

Product-wise Sales Analysis: To investigate how sales vary for different products or categories.

Outcome:
This exploration will provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, market trends, and potential areas for further investigation.
